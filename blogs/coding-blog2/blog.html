            If you had visited my portfolio website <a href="https://praveenraovpportfolio.herokuapp.com/">https://praveenraovpportfolio.herokuapp.com/</a>, you might have seen that I have mentioned that I am "aspiring to becoming successful as a front-end web developer" or "committed to becoming a first rate web developer". Initially, I was a Python programmer. Yeah, I coded some buggy GTK apps for myself on Linux to suit my whims. But then, why did I switch over to the complete opposite end of the spectrum from app making to website development? This blog might give an insight about my path as a web developer.

        <p><strong>How I started Coding?</strong><br>I was introduced to QBasic when I was 12 years old when I was at school, and I hated it (lol). Probably because of the way it was taught to me, or the syntax probably made me wonder where do we even use such software.<br>
        Fast forward to 2 years, I learnt basic HTML in my school and I didn't think much about it at that time. Then I learnt C and C++ when I was in high school.<br>
        The problem was, I learnt C and C++ through Borland or Turbo C/C++ (yeah ik, we were transported back in time to 1996), and it had no realtime applications in 2019. So I had to start from scratch on learning Modern C and C++, and got pretty good at it. It was around this time that I started to show an interest in Python programming language and started making GTK applications for myself in Linux. <br>

        <p><strong>How did I utilize my time in the pandemic</strong>While I was asking myself the question of "Which field of development should I enter into?", the pandemic struck. Indian government had announced 2 weeks of holiday at that time. As I thought I wouldn't get a better chance of wasting my time, I lazed around, playing video games.<br>
        But then after about a month I realized this pandemic isn't going to end any sooner. At this point of time I had an inspiration of doing app development after I watched a couple of YouTube videos, and installed Android Studio, only to find out the main programming language used for Android Studio was Java which was one of my least favorite languages.
